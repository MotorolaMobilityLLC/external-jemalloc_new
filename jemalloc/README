jemalloc is a general-purpose scalable concurrent malloc(3) implementation.
This distribution is a stand-alone "portable" implementation that currently
targets only Linux.  jemalloc is included as the default allocator in the
FreeBSD and NetBSD operating systems, and it is used by the Mozilla Firefox web
browser on Microsoft Windows-related platforms.  Depending on your needs, one
of the other divergent versions may suit your needs better than this
distribution.

The INSTALL file contains information on how to configure, build, and install
